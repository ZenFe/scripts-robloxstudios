### Documentation

We started in 2019 to develop our first scripts and exploits, We started doing continuous tests to develop a very good exploit, This project went wrong, we made another one a script called BEHH, This project was closed, It developed quite well in the year, but we kept learning more about LUA programming from [ROBLOX](https://roblox.com) we learned a little bit in month 4 and we started to make this project it seems that it is silly but we don't dedicate every day to make a good script, this project was created in 4 of 4 of 2019, Let's talk about its fame its first day of launch was not the best nor the worst, it was basically a disaster, it came a month after the launch, we already had 21, and now we have MANY like about 1239 users.
