# Frequently asked questions

- Why am I not on the whitelist and why did I register? : This happens because there are a lot of people in the registration waiting time if it is over 1 hour contact us quickly.
- Why DowlHub is patched? : Because roblox fixes the engines and sometimes we are overloaded with registration requests.
- xxHub does not work, why?: Well this happens because xxHub is not updated and NET was patched on roblox.

# Obfuscated

Here is an example of an obfuscate, the code is hidden

```lua
return(function(h,i,r)local l=string.char;local e=string.sub;local o=table.concat;local n=math.ldexp;local s=getfenv or function()return _ENV end;local p=select;local g=unpack or table.unpack;local j=tonumber;local function k(h)local b,c,d="","",{}local f=256;local g={}for a=0,f-1 do g[a]=l(a)end;local a=1;local function i()local b=j(e(h,a,a),36)a=a+1;local c=j(e(h,a,a+b-1),36)a=a+b;return c end;b=l(i())d[1]=b;while a<#h do local a=i()if g[a]then c=g[a]else c=b..e(b,1,1)end;g[f]=b..e(c,1,1)d[#d+1],b,f=c,c,f+1 end;return table.concat(d)end;local 
```

This is just an example this clearly does not work, but this is what we have inside our scripts.
We hide our scripts because we know there are curious people in our github, that's why we only hide it!
The developers have an admin panel and therefore we do not want them to see the script.

|:-------------|:------------------|:---------------|
| Patched      | Red               | Sometimes      |
| Working      | Green             | Many Times     |  
| Regularly    | Yellow            | Few times      |
| Possibly     | Black             | Few times      |


# Upgrade Time

Every 66 days we change the users on lists such as Blacklist and Whitelist. 
This is only to differentiate between users with bad customer behavior and good customer behavior.
If you are put on the blacklist you will not be able to enter DowlHub 
for several days but if you are on the whitelist every day you will be able to enter with your key.

### Blacklist problems 

- You will not have access for 66 days
- You will not have the key
- Your key is reset
- The TLS is reset
- All saved data is gone

### Whitelist advantages

- TLS Updated
- Data constantly updated
- Key updated
- Good client
- No key reset unless you are put on the blacklist.
